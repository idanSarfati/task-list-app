# ✅ Task List App

A sleek and minimalistic task list application for managing daily to-dos. Users can add, complete, and delete tasks — all within an intuitive and responsive interface.

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project was built to showcase:
- Clean and modern frontend design using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- DOM manipulation and dynamic content rendering
- Component-based thinking without frameworks
- Potential for backend expansion (e.g., persistent storage, user accounts)

---

## 🛠️ Stack Used

- **HTML** – Semantic and accessible structure
- **CSS** – Custom styling for an elegant UI
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Core logic for interaction and task state
- *(Optional backend coming soon: Java with Spring Boot + H2)*

---

## 💻 How to Run Locally

> No installations or dependencies needed — just open the HTML file in your browser.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

🌱 Optional Future Features
These features can be added to expand the app:

Persistent storage with a backend (e.g. H2, SQLite, or Firebase)

Backend server with REST API (Java/Spring Boot or Node.js/Express)

Authentication: multiple users, saved sessions

Task categories, due dates, and priorities

Drag-and-drop reordering of tasks

Mobile-first PWA (Progressive Web App) features

Tests (unit & integration using Jest or Spring Boot Testing)

✨ Bonus Details (Optional)
Responsive Design: Fully responsive for both desktop and mobile

Clean Code: Easy to extend or migrate to a framework

Deployable: Can be hosted as a static site via Vercel, GitHub Pages, or Netlify

🚀 Live Demo
Coming soon (once deployed on Vercel or Render)
